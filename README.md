The server acts as the central hub, receiving and sending messages to the connected clients. This system demonstrates the basic functionality of networking using sockets in Python.

## Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Clients can send and receive messages instantly through the server.
- **Multiple Client Support**: The server can handle multiple clients connecting and exchanging messages simultaneously.
- **Simple and Efficient**: The system is built with Python sockets, offering an efficient, lightweight messaging platform.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Socket Programming**

## How to Run

1. **Start the Server**  
   Open a terminal and run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   python Servery.py

2. **Start the client program**  
   Open a terminal and run the following command to start the client:
   ```bash
